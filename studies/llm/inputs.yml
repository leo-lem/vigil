      The product is fine, but nothing about it feels special.
      I like the design, yet the performance is disappointing.
      Support was quick, although the answer did not actually solve the issue.
      It works as advertised, but I would not recommend it to friends.

      Review: “Works, mostly”
      Date: 2026-02-10
      Order: #A19-5521

      Pros:
      - fast delivery
      - packaging was ok

      Cons:
      - setup took forever (docs are confusing)
      - battery life is not great

      Overall: I wanted to like it, but I probably would not buy again.

      Hi support,
      thanks for the quick reply. However, the suggested steps didn’t fix it.

      The UI looks nice.
      But it freezes when I click “Export”.
      Error shown: “Unexpected token …”

      Please advise.

      Short notes (copied from chat):
      - “works on my machine” (not on mine)
      - nice idea, bad execution
      - refund was processed quickly though

      Also: why is there so much whitespace in the email   sometimes?
